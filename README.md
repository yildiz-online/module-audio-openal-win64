## Build instructions

Go to your root directory, where you POM file is located.

Then invoke maven

for windows:

	mvn clean install -Denv=win32 -Pnative
	
for linux:

	mvn clean install -Denv=linux64 -Pnative


This will compile the source code, then run the unit tests, and finally build a jar file and DLL/SO for the environment you chose.

This can only be done on linux, window does not support cross compilation.

To build the linux artifact, some libraries must be installed:

	apt-get install openal-dev
	apt-get install physfs-dev
	apt-get install libsndfile-dev
	
To build the windows artifact, prebuilt libraries are provided.

## Usage

In your maven project, add the dependency

for windows:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>be.yildiz-games</groupId>
    <artifactId>module-audio-openal</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.6</version>
	<classifier>win32</classifier>
</dependency>
```
